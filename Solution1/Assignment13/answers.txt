What does ChIP-Seq mean?
Chromatin Immunoprecipitation by Sequencing -> identify where regulators (TFs) bind to the genome 
1) Cross link cells & purify DNA from cross linked cells.
2) Isolate Chromatin material and wind up with pieces of DNA with proteins occupying. 
3) Sonication: Use ultrasound waves in solution to shear DNA. 
4) Immunoprecipitation: Immunopurify small fragments with an antibody. (Antibody to a protein of interest) 
5) Reverse cross linking & DNA purification.
-> sequencing every fragment with NGS to find the binding sites of the regulators 

ChIP -> Sequence -> Mapping -> Signal Map -> Peak Detection -> Analysis 



What does RNA-Seq mean?
Determination of the nucleotide sequence of RNA
1) Isolate mRNA from a cell 
2) Perform the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Now we are reverse engineering the DNA template that would have generated the mRNA.
3) DNA polymerase begins to synthesize the other complementary DNA strand. -> The cDNA is built. 


What does NFKB stand for?
- NFKB = Nuclear Factor kappa B


What does Pol2 stand for?
RNA polymerase II is the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of mRNA and many non-coding RNAs 
POLR2A encodes RNA polymerase II subunit B1 (RPB1), the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II

What does H3K27me3 stand for? 
H3: for H3 family of histones
K: standard abbreviation for lysine
27: position of amino acid residue (counting form N-terminus)
me: methyl group
3: number of methyl groups added 
-> epigenetic modification to the DNA packaging protein Histone H3
